# MOVIES-2WATCH

> This `CAPSTONE PROJECT` is to attest that the members of this team of authors have completed the second module of the Microverse curriculum called, ***JavaScript and Networking***.
We built a movie app sends and receives data to and from not just one, but two APIs to display a large array of tv shows and allow for engagements: likes, comments and reservations for each and every show. It also displays indepth information about each show, alongside a rating to make it easy for anyone who is looking for a great show to relax on. Check it out, and support us with a star if you like it. Demo screenshots are shown below:
